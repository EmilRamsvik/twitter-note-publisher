High performers are twice as likely to exceed organizational performance goals and non-commercial performance goals as low-performance teams. 
Four measures of software delivery performance:
Deployment frequency
Meantime to restart
Lead time
Change failure percentage
No trade-offs between improving performance and achieving higher levels of tempo.
Deployment frequency is highly correlated with version control comprehensive use and continuous deployment.
Lead time is highly correlated with version control and automated testing.
High performers have the shortest integration times. Branch life less than one day.

Competition: Some species compete for common resources. Species that compete for space, food or habitat can regulate the abundance of other species.
Body size affects mode of regulation. Smaller animals are regulated by predators and larger animals by food supply.
Density: regulation of some species depends upon their density
Migration increases animal numbers by increasing access to food (reducing bottom-up regulation) and decreasing susceptibility to predation (reducing top-down regulation).

603,Sean Carrol,Serengeti Rules,Density: regulation of some species depends upon their density
604,Sean Carrol,Serengeti Rules,Migration increases animal numbers by increasing access to food (reducing bottom-up regulation) and decreasing susceptibility to predation (reducing top-down regulation).

607,Sean Carrol,Serengeti Rules,"In 1976 Indonesia, pestilence swept the rice fields. An insect called brown planthopper devastated the rice fields. 350,000 tons of rice were lost, enough to feed 3 million people over an entire year. When treated with pesticides, the insect population increased 800-fold. This was due to a multitude of factors: 
The insect had evolved resistance to commonly applied pesticides.
The pesticides actually increased the rate of egg-laying by about 2.5 fold
The pesticides killed wolf spiders and other natural predators of the brown planthoppers. Kill the predators and the prey runs amok.

Write down the concept or problem you won't understand at the top of a piece of paper.
In the space below, explain the idea did as if you had to teach it to someone else.     
If it is a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to someone who's never heard of it before.
If it is a problem, explain how to solve it and, crucially, why that's solution procedure makes sense.


When you get stuck, meaning your understanding fails to provide a clear answer, go back to your book or test or teacher or reference material to find the answer.

Meta-learning: First draw a map of what you want to learn.
Learn how you will learn, do your research on resources and tools that will help you achieve your learning outcome.
Focus: Sharpen your knife. 
Find the time to learn and concentrate.
Directness: Go straight ahead. 
Focus on the thing you want to learn. Remove all secondary and trivial learning activities.
Drill: Attack your weakest point.
Break down complex skills into small parts and focus to improve your weakest points.
Retrieval: Test to learn.
Test yourself before you feel ready. Push yourself to actively recall information rather than possibly review material.
Feedback: Don't dodge the punches. 
Extract the signal from noise, don't be afraid of harsh feedback.
Retention: Don't fill a leaky bucket. 
Understand what you are forgetting and why.
Intuition: Dig deep before building up. Understand how understanding works, not memorization.
Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone.
 True understanding comes from exploring and experimenting on your own.
